 <h1>BANANA BREAD</h1>   
    
<img src="banana-bread.jpg">
    
    <p1> The best recipes come tried and true from friends who begged them from other friends and so on and so on. That’s the wonderful thing about sharing recipes – the more good recipes we share, the better we all get to eat! This banana bread comes from my friend Heidi who years ago begged this recipe from a ski friend’s mother – Mrs. Hockmeyer (parents of friends are always Mr. and Mrs. no matter how old we get). Mrs. Hockmeyer passed away years ago, but her simple but perfect banana bread lives on for all of us to enjoy.</p1>
